### Google Analytics
Google analytics helps you understand the audience of the website better. For exmaple, you would probably get the data about the where most of the visits are from, which page receives most visits and things like that.

####How to set up
It is really easy to link Google Analytics to your website.  
First, you have to go to [register](http://www.google.com/analytics/) at Google Analytics. Then, you will receive the corresponding code for your website like this: 

```html
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'YOUR CODE GENERATED BY GOOGLE', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
```

### Add Comment Area to the Blog

#### How to set up
Go to [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com/) to register for a blog and then you are able to allow your visitors to leave comments on your blog.

After you register for an account, you can get a **Universal Code** from the website. Then you can add 

```html
{% if page.comments %}
 *** UNIVERSAL CODE***
{% endif %}
```

after your main blog content.
